Looks terrible at first, often dismissed as filler. 

However, it became its own archetype later on, and gained a cult following.

The playstyle revolves around King of the Skull Servants, which gains 1000 ATK for each Skull Servant and “Skull Servant”–named card in the Graveyard, 
making decks centered around milling Skull servant as much as possible.

I personally love when Yugioh builds around indvidually extremely weak monsters and make them good and usable.
