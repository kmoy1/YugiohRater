Another classic card that represents a knight from Arthurian legend (early Yugioh had a LOT of this stuff). 

But for a monster needing two tributes, it really is quite terrible.

Regardless, its popularity made Konami give it a bunch of spin-offs later on (which were, for the most part, also ass).
