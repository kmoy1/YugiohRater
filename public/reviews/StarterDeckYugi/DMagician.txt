The heart of Yami Yugi's deck. 

Description is a little ironic because Dark Magician's stats kind of suck for a monster that needs 2 tributes. 
But it has received RIDICULOUS support over the years. Unfortunately, unlike Blue Eyes, its time in the meta was shorter lived.

Regardless, another icon of Yugioh.
